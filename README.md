# One-Tweet
Typography poster based on One Tweet using One Family and max 3 colors. 
I was going through online and manage to figure how to input words into a big alphabet and came up with some designs above. The reason why I chose the word 'S' is because that is Edward's surname "Snowden". And I chose a lot of Red & Blue is because Snowden is currently seeking asylum in Russia and that's their primary flag color.
